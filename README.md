# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for completing this project was to familiarize myself with web development before starting Columbia's full stack coding bootcamp. I built this project as a guide to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to understand and start to learn about web page development, as well as the structures and elements that are contained within the world of software engineering.
